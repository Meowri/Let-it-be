I am Mari and I come from South Africa.

It may be from growing up in the African sun that I have a sunny disposition!  I hope to make great friends with you all and support you in any way I can! Where I come from [ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) is very important! 

I am a mommy's girl...and my mom raised me that as long as you do something that makes you happy, you will always find the money will come. I followed my heart and studied Fine Art at the University of Cape Town, while I am waiting for my mom's wisdom to hold true, I would like to acquire some skills that can aid this process of being financially stable.


_As an Artist I want to invoke knowledge and break boundaries._ 

_As a Designer I want to free advertisements to the realm deemed 'Art'_ 

_As a developer I want to reach and influence those outside of my reach!_

If I can get up this mountain, I can do anything!
